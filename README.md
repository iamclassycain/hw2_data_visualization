# Homework 2: Data Visualization of TV Show Metrics for Black Mirror and Game of Thrones

**Assignment Brief:** Perform a simple data visualization on a dataset of your choice and create a webpage that describes the results.  

**Note:** The episode runtimes for Game of Thrones was modified in order to create numerical diversity within the dataset. The original dataset shows a length of 60 minutes for the majority of episodes, which would make for uninteresting plots.

#### Learning Objectives
1. Complete a python project entirely on your own
2. Integrate python knowledge with HTML/Markdown knowledge
3. Understand how python allows more advanced data analysis than tools like excel
